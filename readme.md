# Risk Assessment for Power Communication Network based on Topological Correlation of Multivariate Spatio-Temporal Data

## Introduction

This project focuses on assessing the risk of nodes in a power communication network based on the topological
correlation of multivariate spatiotemporal data.  
Below are the model illustration:
